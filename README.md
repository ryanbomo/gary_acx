# ACX Crawler

This is the README.md for an ACX.com crawler that I am writing for a friend. The idea is that the user will be able to have something that can actively notify them if there is a new match to their criteria on ACX.com.  This will go through a few phases for the final product is ready.

Versioning for the phases will look like this: XX.YY.ZZ where XX is the release number, YY is the phase number, and ZZ is the build number for that phase. For example, the initial build for phase 1 before release will look like: 0.1.1. The final build number for phase 1 will be 1.0.0

## Phase 1

Phase 1 is an active implementation of the crawler.  This means that the user must manually execute the crawl. The crawl is not automated, and a CSV document is maintained by the crawler. The idea is to get a running workable script for now, while working on better features down the road. The active crawler will have roughly 85% of the functionality of the final product.

### Version 0.1.1

Below are the curent features for the ACX Crawler:

  * Generate URL based on filter list
